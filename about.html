<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
    Hi! I'm Abhirami TPV, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering at 
    Amal Jyothi College of Engineering. I have a deep interest in programming, technology, and innovation. 
    Throughout my academic journey, I have been exploring various domains in computing such as software 
    development, web technologies, and problem-solving through code.
</p>
<p>
    I enjoy taking on new challenges, learning modern technologies, and applying what I learn to real-world scenarios. 
    Apart from academics, I like participating in tech-related workshops, events, and hackathons to improve my skills 
    and expand my knowledge. My goal is to become a skilled software developer and contribute meaningfully to the 
    tech industry.
